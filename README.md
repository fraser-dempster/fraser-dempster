### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Fraser, currently a Full Stack Developer at Barclays where I build, test, and deploy multiple applications to provide the best experience for our retail investing customers.

I enjoy working on my own projects whilst discovering and learning new technologies. I've just finished my portfolio which can be found here: [fraserdempster.com](fraserdempster.com)
